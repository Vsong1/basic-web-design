            Pink fairy armadillos are indefinitely cuter than normal-colored average-sized armadillos. Such a fact is undeniable. At this point, some would perhaps that these animals do not even exist. They are, after all, named after a mythological humanoid. But fret not! They do.

            Now that the point has been made, perhaps you might want to learn more about these creatures.
