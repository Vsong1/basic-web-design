                <p>As the day yields to night, festival goers gather to release store-bought or handmade lanterns to the sky. In some countries sky lanterns are banned due to fire hazard; some people will have to settle for hanging lanterns instead.</p>

                <p><i>Dengmi</i>, or lantern riddles, are a popular game during the festival. Classic riddles and puns, often derived from local legends and folklore, are scribbled on sheets of colored papers dangling from storefront lanterns. Children who solve them can get a small prize from the lantern's owner.</p>
