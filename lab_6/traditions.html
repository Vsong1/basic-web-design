                <h2>The Party, The Food, The Games</h2>
                <p>The Lantern Festival is in fact a festival, and like other festivals, it is visited for its food and atmosphere. But the celebration is also very symbolic. The festival is on the 15th day of the first lunar year, and represents the end of the new year celebrations. As it is, people keep positive for this day in hopes of good luck through the rest of the year. In some cities, lanterns are still released at night; in others, people hang their lanterns from porches, windows, and streetlights. There is much dancing and partying, with large festivals involving large parades of people in dragon costumes (to scare off demons) and firecrackers. For children, lantern riddles existed. Solving these folktale and pun-based riddles was considered "harder than fighting a tiger," and solving them would bring good luck in the coming year.</p>
                <p>As for food, everything is sweet. To make you sweeter. Literally. Commonly consumed on the day of the Lantern Festival are <i>tangyuan</i>, a sweet soup with glutinous rice balls in it. The rice balls are filled with a sweet peanut-lard or black-sesame paste, and are definitely worth trying. Families also often have a final hot pot dinner, where food is cooked in a pot of broth on a hot plate, before returning to their normal lives and waiting for the next year.</p>

                <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
                <p>Because of the limited number of phonetic sounds in Chinese, puns are ridiculously easy to make. Even many ritualistic parts of the Lantern Festival involve puns. For example, <i>tangyuan</i> literally translates to "soup balls," but is a homophone for both "union" and "gather around."</p>
