                <h3>On the 15th day of the lunar calendar, millions of people across the globe gather to celebrate the Lantern Festival.</h3>
                <p>On this day, streets throughout China and neighboring countries are filled with children and adults alike, all partaking in the thousands of years-old tradition. They celebrate the end of the past and the beginning of the future, of forgiveness and remembrance. Under the light of the sun, the streets bustle with games and dancing. As the sun sets and the full moon rises, the lanterns for which the festival is named are released to the skies.</p>
                <p>Yet for such an important event in Asian culture, this is a tradition all but unknown by the Western world. But that doesn't mean you can't learn about it, or celebrate it in your own community. Learn about the history and traditions which make up the Lantern Festival, and how even non-Asians can celebrate this remembrance of ancestors.</p>
