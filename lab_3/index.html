        <h2>Within the Amazon Rainforest...</h2>
        <p>Spider monkeys dwell in the upper canopy layer of the rainforest. Dubbed one of Americas' most intelligent monkeys, these primates spend their days swinging from tree to tree with their long arms and prehensile tails. Due to their relatively short legs and rigidly-shaped torso, they are not adapted to fast travel on land and cannot evade predators for long on the forest floor. Now, with the rapid deforestation of their ancestral homes, their populations are being decimated as they are divided by the loss of trees.</p>
